# fourdle
I'm gonna make wordle but it's only four letters using good ol' python.

Goals:
* Find dictionary library for words X
* Color text appropriately X
* Create game structure, looping X

Stretch:
* Log past scores to save file X
* Make it look pretty - Not gonna happen
* Filter swears/slurs - Also not gonna happen, they should count but aren't in the game words

Journal:
* 5/12/22: Started repo, messed around with color codes with gusto.
* 5/16/22: Added some words from https://7esl.com/4-letter-words/. Will add more later.
* 5/18/22: Finished game structure, with a few bugs.
* I kinda missed journaling for a while, here's some stuff that happened in order.
  * Added stats.
  * Finished structure.
  * Changed coloring to fit Wordle logic.
  * Fixed bugs.
  * Commented code
* 6/9/22: Finally fixed the last bug, a nasty one. Final version.
